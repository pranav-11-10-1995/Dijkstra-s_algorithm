# Dijkstra-s_algorithm
step 1: #define MAX_SIZE 8 /* Update as per number of nodes in main.cpp*/
step 2:Update number of nodes value in NumNodes and write all node names in graph.node.txt
step 3: Always start with node A as first node and shortest distance is calculated for node A
step 4: Update number of connections in NumPins and mention the nodes that are connected and corresponding weights in graph.nets.txt
